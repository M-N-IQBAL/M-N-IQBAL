# 👋 Greetings, I'm M.N.IQBAL

I'm learning and practicing cybersecurity by building, breaking, and fixing things in my homelab.  
Most of my learning comes from trying to solve real problems, one command at a time.

I like exploring how attackers move, how defenders respond, and how parts of that process can be automated.  
Whenever I get stuck, I research, test, and sometimes ask ChatGPT to help me understand what's really happening under the hood.
